By my humble reckoning, cURL provides the most straightforward, accessible, and portable interface to OpenAI's API on windows.
The GPT_cURL.ahk file contains working implementations of transcription (through Push-To-Talk), and ways of interacting with GPT through API.
Thanks go to the maintainers of cURL, maintainers of AHK, and maker of fmedia/phiola.
