By my humble reckoning, cURL provides the most straightforward, accessible, and portable interface on Windows to OpenAI's API.

The GPT_cURL.ahk file contains working implementations of transcription (through Push-To-Talk), and ways of interacting with GPT through cURL.

Thanks go to the maintainers of cURL, maintainers of AHK, and maker of fmedia/phiola (portable audio recorder with CLI).

If working behind a proxy, will need to manually update cURL command flags accordingly.
