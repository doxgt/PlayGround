By my reckoning, cURL provides the most straightforward and portable API interface to OpenAI on Windows, especially on PCs that don't have Python already installed.

The GPT_cURL.ahk file contains working implementations of transcription and chat completions through cURL.

Thanks go to the maintainers of cURL, maintainers of AHK, and maker of fmedia/phiola (portable audio recorder with CLI).

NB: If working behind a proxy server, cURL command flags will need to be updated accordingly.
